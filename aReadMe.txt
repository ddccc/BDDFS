This directory has Java examples implementing an abstract
bi-directional depth first search algorithm; see the pdf file.

These examples have all the same structure:
- Define a search space with a start state and a goal state.
- Define a recursive function >move< that does forward, backward and/or
bi-directional search.
- Start the invocation and measure the timing.

There are parameters to be set in the code and hence recompilation is
required to activate a new setting.  Examples are the size of the
search space and the search mode: forward, backward or bi-directional.
